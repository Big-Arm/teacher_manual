Global Cost map & Planner

Global Cost map & Global Planner
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

| We have already created a map through mapping. We will refer to this again as a static map. Based on static map, a **Global Cost Map** is created. The overall path of autonomous driving is completed through this cost map.
|
| Calculating the overall route like this is called the **Global Planner**.
|
| Afterwards, the overall route calculated by the Global Planner is sent to the **Local Planner**.
