        <h2>Explanation</h2>
    </div>

For this mission, with the examples discussed earlier, lets try to create a function that contains 
instructions for the robot to move around an obstacle. 

For this mission you are tasked to create:

- Move and Turn function
- Main function that would manage the sequence of move functions. 

One thing to keep in mind is that the instructions if not ordered correctly will try to send
multiple commands to the robot at the same time. In order to avoid that you may try to apply 
``time.sleep()`` function to wait until the command is complete. 

Example:

.. code-block:: python 

    import rospy
    import json
    from std_msgs.msg import UInt8MultiArray, String
    from nav_msgs.msg import Odometry
    import time
    import math
    import threading

    rospy.init_node('zetabot')
    move_pub = rospy.Publisher('/robot_command', String, queue_size=1)

    def move():
        tmp = {"MoveForward": 1}
        msg = json.dumps(tmp)
        rospy.loginfo("Sent: %s", msg)
        move_pub.publish(msg)

    def back():
        tmp = {"MoveBackward": 1}
        msg = json.dumps(tmp)
        rospy.loginfo("Sent: %s", msg)
        move_pub.publish(msg)
    
    def stop():
        tmp = {"Stop": 0}
        msg = json.dumps(tmp)
        rospy.loginfo("Sent: %s", msg)
        move_pub.publish(msg)
