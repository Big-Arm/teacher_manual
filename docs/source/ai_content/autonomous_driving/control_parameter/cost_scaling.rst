Cost_scaling_factor
===================


*These are the result of changing the value of Cost_scaling_factor.*

The following are the pictures of the change according to the value of the cost scaling factor of the global costmap.

.. figure:: ../images/cost1.webp
   :figwidth: 50 %
   :align: center

   cost scaling factor 3

.. figure:: ../images/cost2.webp
   :figwidth: 50 %

   cost sclaing factor 10

The following are the pictures of the change according to the value of the cost scaling factor of the local costmap.

.. figure:: ../images/cost3.webp
   :figwidth: 50 %
   :align: center

   cost scaling factor 3

.. figure:: ../images/cost4.webp
   :figwidth: 50 %
   :align: center

   cost scaling factor 10

Conclusion: As the cost scaling factor increases, it can be seen that the range of obstacles recognized by autonomous robots increases.
