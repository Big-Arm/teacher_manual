*Different changes based on the value of inflation_layer.*

The following are the pictures of the change according to the value of inflation_radius in the global costmap.

   inflation_radius is 1.5

The following are thepictures of the change according to the value of inflation_radius in the local costmap.

.. figure:: /_images/autonomous_driving/inflation_3.webp
   :figwidth: 70 %
   :align: center

   inflation_radius is 0.8

.. figure:: /_images/autonomous_driving/inflation_4.webp
   :figwidth: 70 %
   :align: center

   inflation_radius is 0.32


Conclusion: As inflation_radius increases, it can be seen that the range of obstacles recognized by autonomous robots increases.
