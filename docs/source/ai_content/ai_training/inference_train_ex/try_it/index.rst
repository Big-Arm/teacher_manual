============

The examples brought in for our trials are NVIDIA Inferencing library which
includes TensorRT-accelerated deep learning networks. These networks are built to 
complete taks such as 

- Image Recognition
- Object Detection with Localization (i.e. bounding boxes)
- Semantic Segmentation
- Pose Estimation
- Depth Estimation

For this section we will run Command Line Instruction to run some of the 
pre-trained models with the example dataset. 

(Note!) All the sample programs will be based on python language.
